# Simple-Node-Deployment
A simple node deployment for AWS with reverse proxy and load balancing.

I have Added a basic Nginx config for load balancing and reverse proxy but there maybe a way to turn that into a puppet manifest according to 

	https://forge.puppetlabs.com/jfryman/nginx

This is the Upstream puppet module.

Adding that to the ToDo list.
